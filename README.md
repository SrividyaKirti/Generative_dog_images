# Generate synthetic dog images using GANs

### What are GANs?
GANs or Generative adversarial networks are used to generate synthetic images that never existed before. They train on real world examples to create realistic fakes.

It has 2 components:
* <b>Generator:</b> Model that is used to generate synthetic images by learning from the real world examples.
* <b>Discriminator:</b> Model that is used to classify examples as real or fake.
